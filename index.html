									<h2>Software Developer and Researcher </h2>
									<h3>Social Futures Lab</h3>
									<p>I am working under Professor Amy Zhang where I research into the bridge of asynchronous and synchronous communication between Zoom, Google Documents, and Slack, and building software to combat this. Some software I work on includes being able to write notes from Slack to your Google Doc notes or clip specific Zoom sections into Slack that you find important.</p>

									<h2>Software Developer Intern</h2>
									<h3>Pacific Northwest Research Institute</h3>
									<p>I developed automation to sequence the destructive LINE-1 gene and analyze its impact and evolution across different ethnicities to help researchers understand it’s determinantal effects and future. I implemented this solution with Perl and Python using tools including BWA Tools, BLAST and BAMTOOLS.  This experience taught me to how to apply my coding skills to solve problems in health care as well as exposed me to new computational tools.  I also learnt how to persevere to find creative solutions and quickly adapt to new technologies and toolsets.</p>

									<h2>Software Developer and Research Assistant</h2>
									<h3>University of Washington, GRID Lab for Neuroengineering</h3>
									<p>I created a software interface that is integrated with epilepsy patients to monitor their neural response and understand their varied brain activity while playing a custom VR game. I implemented this using an OpenXR API layer with C++ that tracks patients’ VR controller and headset position information. This information is then analyzed to create patterns of brain activity.  I presented my work at the University of Washington’s Research Symposium. This being my first advanced research project, I learnt to take an ambiguous problem and methodically work through layers of problem-solving to arrive at the full solution in the end.  </p>

									<h2>Product Manager Intern</h2>
									<h3>RoundPier</h3>
									<p>As a part of RoundPier’s product management team, I created and led an ambassador program, and developed engaging features including an assistor for college applicants and an extracurricular-hosting interface. I worked with the CEO and CTO to provide technical changes to the app, such as by developing a React web page to enhance team progress with an efficient task tracking system, and I provided them with detailed proposals on new features to implement. With this, I helped increase monthly user count by 300% to 75,000 users.  This project taught me the challenges around increasing product usage and adoption.   I got opportunity to try out various creative solutions and eventually achieve 300x increase in usage.</p>

									<h3>Balance Pad</h3>
									<h4>Connecting Productivity with Computer Science</h4>
									<p>I created a web student productivity tool using React JS and Assembly AI that has features including effective transcription for lecture videos, mental health services through a chat box, and timed rest games. I was able to master tools such as React, new APIs including Twilio, and develop a finished product within a 36 hour time frame. With Balance Pad, my team and I placed 1st at DeltaHacks-8. </p>

									<h3>Detection of Liver Disease with ML</h3>
									<h4>Connecting Biology with Computer Science</h4>
									<p>I built and trained computing models including random forest classifier and multilayer perceptron model and analyzed results using advanced computational tools to determine the best model to detect liver disease. With this, I placed at the International Youth Research Seminar with the paper linked. I exhibited qualities of working with a team with diverse skill sets and how to efficiently distribute that, how to take on new technologies (this was my first time with machine learning), and how to develop a question, hypothesis, and analysis. </p>

								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
									<h3>Building UMessage</h3>
									<h4>Connecting Communication and Computer Science</h4>
									<p>Utilizing advanced data structures such as Tries and Binary Trees, I built UMessage, an application that can autofill words and provide suggested next words as typing a message. It was a great way to see how to apply advanced algorithims with a real life scenario. </p>
								</section>
								<section>
									<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
									<h3>Team Task Tracker</h3>
									<h4>Connecting Productivity and Computer Science</h4>
									<p>Using full-stack technologies and frameworks such as React JS, along with my work as a product manager at RoundPier, I built a task tracking tool for the interns to utilize to ensure we are keeping track of our work, deadlines, and more.</p>

									<h3>Plan for Expansion of IMAX into BRIC Countries</h3>
									<p>I built a strategic and thorough plan for IMAX to expand into BRIC nations using careful distribution, marketing, finances through UW’s Selective Consulting Association. With this, I placed 1st at the University of Washington’s PIVOT Case Competition. I gained strong experience in presentation skills and strategic thinking. </p>

									<h3>Connect - Virtual Competition Platform</h3>
									<p>I am building and founding the application, Connect, a web-based tool for virtual competition participants to match and find teammates. My team and I have been selected to join UW's startup incubator program, Dubhacks Next! I have gained a lot of experience in not only web development, but skills of being able to conduct user interviews, build designs on Figma that are accessible, and pitch an idea to potential investors. </p>
